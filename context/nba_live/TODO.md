## üìã **Upcoming Phases**

- [ ] **Phase 2 ‚Äì Database Design & Architecture**
  - [ ] Finalize remaining dimension & fact tables (shots, play-by-play, contracts, injuries)
  - [ ] Add audit history tables or extend `bridge_duckdb_sources`
  - [ ] Implement season-based Parquet partitioning strategy
  - [ ] Generate ER diagram for documentation
  - [ ] Decide on vector storage approach (DuckDB extension vs external)

- [ ] **Phase 3 ‚Äì Modern Era ETL Pipeline**
  - [ ] Research ETL architecture patterns and frameworks
  - [ ] Implement NBA API extractors with rate limiting
  - [ ] Build transformation pipeline with data quality scoring

## üõ† **Technical Debt & Enhancements**

  - [x] Design fuzzy player matcher (birthdate, team overlap, nickname variations)
  - [x] Implement PlayerMatcher class in `etl/deduplication/player_matcher.py`
  - [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for PlayerMatcher
  - [ ] Implement team name normalization utility

- [ ] **Incremental Historical Refresh**
  - [ ] Design quarterly re-scrape job for historical seasons
  - [ ] Implement diff and merge corrections into existing records

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Define index strategy for high-volume queries
  - [ ] Evaluate partitioning (e.g., by season) for `player_game_stats`
  - [ ] Consider materialized views for era aggregates

- [ ] **Retroactive Corrections Framework**
  - [ ] Design `RetroactiveCorrectionsHandler` in `etl/corrections/retroactive_handler.py`
