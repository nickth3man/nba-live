# `nba-live` Project Context

This directory contains the core planning and documentation artifacts for the `nba-live` project, including architecture, requirements, and development logs.

---

## Key Responsibilities

*   Outlines the technical architecture of the system (`architecture.md`).
*   Defines the product vision, scope, and requirements (`prd.md`).
*   Tracks the detailed engineering tasks and project progress (`TODO.md`).
*   Maintains a chronological log of development activities (`journal/`).

## Structure

*   `architecture.md` – The technical architecture documentation for the system.
*   `prd.md` – The Product Requirements Document (PRD).
*   `TODO.md` – A detailed engineering task list.
*   `journal/` – A chronological log of development activities and decisions.

## Roadmap

1.  Finalize the `architecture.md` and `prd.md` documents.
2.  Keep the `TODO.md` updated as development progresses.
