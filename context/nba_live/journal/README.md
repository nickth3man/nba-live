# Engineering Journal

This component serves as a development log, capturing a chronological record of tasks, milestones, and significant events in the project's lifecycle.

---

## Key Responsibilities

*   Provides a historical context for development decisions.
*   Tracks project progress over time through dated and timestamped entries.

## Structure

The journal is organized into subdirectories by date, following a `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Within each directory, individual entries are saved as Markdown files with a `HHMM-task-name.md` naming convention.

*   `YYYY-MM-DD/` – A directory for a specific day's journal entries.
*   `HHMM-task-name.md` – A specific journal entry, timestamped and named for the task.

## Roadmap

1.  Continue to log all significant development activities in the journal.
2.  Use the journal to inform project retrospectives and planning sessions.

*For project-wide planning, see the [full roadmap](../../PLAN.md).*
