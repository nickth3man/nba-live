# Project Research

This component contains the foundational research that informs the strategic and architectural decisions for the `nba-live` project. It includes analysis of the open-source landscape, a summary of best practices, and a technical blueprint for the database schema.

## Key Responsibilities

*   Provides a comprehensive analysis of over 30 existing open-source NBA data projects to learn from the community.
*   Distills actionable insights and best practices to guide development and prevent common pitfalls.
*   Specifies the recommended database schema patterns with concrete DDL examples.

## Structure

*   `existing-projects.md` – A market and architectural analysis of the open-source NBA data landscape.
*   `lessons-learned.md` – A prescriptive guide of best practices and pitfalls to avoid.
*   `schema-patterns.md` – The technical blueprint for the project's database schema.

## Roadmap

1.  Apply the schema patterns from `schema-patterns.md` to the core database DDL.
2.  Ensure the development process adheres to the principles outlined in `lessons-learned.md`.
