# NBA-Live

NBA-Live is an open-source, local analytics warehouse that archives every NBA
season from 1946-present and exposes clean, auditable data for research,
betting models, and fan exploration.

poetry install

# Create DuckDB file and load sample Kaggle players
poetry run python -m nba_live.etl.kaggle.load_kaggle_players \
  --csv data/sample/players.csv \
  --db nba_live.duckdb
```

1. Complete remaining dimension & fact tables.
2. Build ETL loaders for games, boxscores, shots, play-by-play.
3. Implement data-quality scoring & audit dashboards.
4. Add LangChain-powered FastAPI for natural-language queries.
