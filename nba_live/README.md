# NBA-Live Codebase

This directory will host the application code (ETL, API, AI agent).

Key subfolders (to be created):

* `etl/` – data extraction, transformation, load scripts
* `db/` – schema and migration SQL
* `ai/` – embedding generator and query agent
* `tests/` – pytest suites

For high-level planning and documentation, see the [`context/`](../context) folder.
